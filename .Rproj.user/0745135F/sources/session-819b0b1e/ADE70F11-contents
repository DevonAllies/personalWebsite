## Introduction:

Hi, my name is Devon. I am currently a Master's student in the [TB Host Genetics Group](http://www.sun.ac.za/english/faculty/healthsciences/Molecular_Biology_Human_Genetics/tbhostgenetics) majoring in Bioinformatics & Computational Biology.

Outside of my studies, I enjoy sim racing, primarily [iRacing](https://www.iracing.com/), and flight simulators, mainly [X-Plane 12](https://www.x-plane.com/) These hobbies align with my constant need to learn and develop myself in a data-driven world.

With over a decade of experience spanning immunology, bioinformatics, and computational biology, I specialize in unraveling the complexities of tuberculosis. My work focuses on developing data-driven bioinformatics solutions and coordinating impactful clinical studies.

As a Project Coordinator at the Division of Molecular Biology and Human Genetics, I'm dedicated to streamlining research operations, ensuring impeccable data integrity, and fostering seamless collaboration among stakeholders.

I'm passionate about leveraging tools like Python, R, Power BI, and Nextflow to integrate bioinformatics and computational biology, ultimately aiming to drive scientific innovation and improve healthcare outcomes. Let's connect and explore how we can make a difference.
